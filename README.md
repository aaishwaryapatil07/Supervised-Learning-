# Supervised-Learning

Supervised learning is a learning in which we teach or train the machine using data which is well labeled that means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data

This repository contains 6 files in which label is categorial or distributed. Dataset is analysed, visualised and plotted to find best suited algorithm for the dataset
